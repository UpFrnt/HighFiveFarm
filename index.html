                    High Five Farm is a two person team growing vegetables, herbs, and more on two leased 
                    acres in Woodford County. High Five produce is grown using non-certified organic methods, 
                    low-impact machinery and hand tools, locally sourced composts, and never sprayed with 
                    synthetic pesticides or amended with petro-chemical fertilizers. Farmers Chelsea and 
                    Alex are guided by their beliefs in simplicity, community, service, and ecological stewardship.

                     <p>High Five Farm is operated by Chelsea &#39Chelly&#39 Barbour <i>(she/her/hers)</i> and Alex Rickman <i>(he/him/his)</i>
                        , two lovebirds who started this farm business in 2020. Alex enjoys playing chess, cooking, and playing music. 
                        Chelly loves sending postcards, wildflower and tree identification, and tidying up.
                        The name High Five celebrates teamwork, community cooperation, recognition of challenging physical work, 
                        and that good feeling after a job well done.

                    <br>
                    <p>Most of our farming practices are non-mechanized and rely on work by hand, as we try to minimize the use of 
                        fossil fuels on the farm. We rely on cover crops, locally sourced horse manure compost, and hay for our soil 
                        fertility instead of petrochemical fertilizers. We try to disturb the soil as little as possible in order to 
                        maintain a high soil organic matter content, reduce erosion, and retain water more efficiently. We&#39re 
                        working on  transitioning our tunnel production to no-till. Floating row covers, insect netting, landscape 
                        fabric, and an intricate crop rotation are all utilized frequently to keep weeds and pests at bay instead 
                        of spraying insecticides and herbicides which inevitably will harm the ecosystem in and around the farm.<br><br></p>

                     <p>High Five Farm operates on a low budget. We are slowly and steadily building our business using minimal infrastructure and simple equipment. Farm dreams include raising hogs, egg-layers, poultry, rabbits, and flowers in the next few seasons.</p><br>
                    <p>While we are currently operating as an LLC, we hope to shift to a cooperative/collective model as we connect with more folks in KY. We are seeking partners. We don’t know what this will look like exactly, but we do have ideas. We hope to work with people in our community interested in radically cooperative business strategies like community land ownership, consensus-based decision making, equipment sharing, skill trades, and collaborating with other growers to offer many different products. </p>

                harvest of 6-10 items, grown by us, for you!  CSA members are encouraged to try new things and are equipped 
                with a recipe booklet designed for that week&#39s offerings by Chef Toby Olsen. Connect with us through our weekly 
                CSA member newsletter highlighting our growing practices, storage tips, and farmer check-ins. 
            </p> <br>
            <p>Members of a CSA program are enthusiastically opting into the inherent risks involved in farming. Not every crop 
                we attempt to grow will be a success. You will share in the failures and successes of the farm, thereby genuinely 
                supporting local small agriculture. </p><br>
            <p>Our CSA is available on a sliding scale, you will select which payment plan is most reasonable for you and your family. 
                Learn more about our sliding scale CSA program and join today!

            <p>Access to fresh and healthy food is a basic human right. During our inaugural season, we were able to 
            offer one third of our shares at no cost to families seeking assistance accessing fresh produce. 
            This effort was achieved through community crowd sourced funds. Let us offer FREE produce again 
            this season by contributing today.</p>
